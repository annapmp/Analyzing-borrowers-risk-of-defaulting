# Analyzing-borrowers-risk-of-defaulting
This project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. 
We need to find out if a customer’s features have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. 
The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.
I'll build a **credit scoring** of a potential customer. A ** credit scoring ** is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.
